    <p>Originally passed in an attempt to deter crime, this policy is controversial, and critics question whether it achieves its aim. Governor Cuomo, in response to pressure from diverse civil society coalitions, tasked a committee with studying the policy and releasing “actionable recommendations”—which could include raising the age of criminal responsibility to the national norm of 18—and which the committee will announce before December is over. </p>

<h3 align="center" class="subhed">Who does this policy impact now?</h3>

    <p>Overwhelmingly, we’re talking about youth of color. Of the 16 and 17 year olds incarcerated as adults in New York City in 2010, <a class="percent" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRuStHzdLAE">91.8%</a> fell in that category. 67% of them were black, according to Abigail Kramer, Associate Editor at the Center for NYC Affairs at the New School, who shared the data at an October panel discussion about the policy. </p>

    <p>These youth are “mostly from poverty and low-performing schools,” and often their past includes “significant trauma,” such as abuse and mental illness, said Judge Edwina Richardson-Mendleson, the administrative judge of the family court system in New York City, at the presentation. </p>

<p>Under the current policy, sixteen and seventeen year olds are tried in adult criminal courts; when sentenced to incarceration, they are held in adult prisons. If the policy is changed, these teens would be instead tried in family courts and, if found guilty, sent to juvenile detention facilities. </p>

<p>New York set the age of criminal responsibility at sixteen in 1967. Proponents at the time argued it would discourage youth from committing crimes. Only two studies in the ensuing years have examined whether this is true; both found it does not deter crime, and furthermore, both found that treating adolescents as adults increases the rates of recidivism. Jeffrey Fagan, a lawyer and researcher at Columbia University who authored one of the <a class="study" href="http://www.housedems.ct.gov/jjpic/Fagan_Comparative Sanctions in Juv and Crim Court L%26P96.pdf">studies</a>, compared adolescents tried as adults in New York with those of the same age, tried for the same crimes, in the juvenile justice system in neighboring New Jersey. He found that 53% of the adolescents who went through criminal court ended up back in jail, while only 41% of those who went through juvenile justice system recidivated. Furthermore, his study showed the 53% were rearrested sooner, and for more serious crimes, than their counterparts in the 41% who were treated as juveniles. </p>

<p> “It should come as no surprise that sixteen and seventeen year olds go deeper into criminality when they are placed in adult facilities and treated as adult criminals,” said Judge Mendelson. </p>

    <h3 align="center" class="subhed">How many teenagers are we talking about?</h3>

    <p>In 2013, 33,407 sixteen and seventeen year olds across the state were arrested, and 34,263 appeared in adult criminal court. 842 of them were sentenced to jail, according to the Department of Criminal Justice Services. (The others were dismissed, acquitted or sent to diversion programs.) These numbers have been steadily dropping in the past five years. In 2011, there were 41,877 court appearances in the age group, with 1,009 sentenced to jail. In 2009, over ten thousand more teens appeared in court than last year—45,814—and over two hundred and thirty more of them were sent to jail than last year. </p>
    
    <p>Currently, 92 of these teens are incarcerated in New York state prisons, according to the Department of Corrections and Community Supervision. About 860 are in New York City jails, according to the New York City Independent Budget Office.  </p>
    
    <p>In addition to increasing the chances that teens will later take part in serious crimes, critics cite the frequent physical, emotional and sexual abuse that many teens face when incarcerated with adults. However, the exact incidence of abuse is hard to track because the teens often don’t report it, says Brooklyn Assemblyman Joe Lentol, who advocates for the age of legal responsibility to be raised to eighteen. </p>
    
    <p>The policy’s documented ineffectiveness and traumatic effects on the youth involved leave few supporters. Both New York Chief Judge Lippman and Governor Cuomo have called for raising the age to 18 in at least some circumstances. </p>
    
     <p>Advocates of raising the age argue that sending sixteen and seventeen year olds to family court — as younger teenagers are treated — would address some of these problems. Family court offers “a developmentally appropriate pathway to treatment” and “services for youth and their families—legal, educational and social,” said Judge Mendleson. “Family court judges must consider youth’s best interest in addition to community protection and victim safety. That’s not in adult court,” she said.</p>
     
      <p>As a result, “Every family court judge I have spoken through throughout the state believe these cases should be committed in family court,” said Mendleson.</p>
      
       <h3 align="center" class="subhed"> With seemingly all evidence in favor of raising the age, why hasn’t it be done yet?</h3>
      
       <p>In short, because changing the policy in a responsible way will cost money. The change would divert the thousands of cases every year involving these teens to the state’s family courts, which are already backlogged. The state will somehow need to furnish that system with new judges, courtrooms, trainings, and social workers. Furthermore, juvenile detention costs far more than adult incarceration.</p>
       
       <p>And this, youth justice advocate Sonja Okun says, is the most potent argument against raising the age in New York. “There aren’t many political barriers, even upstate where it’s more conservative. It’s an economic issue,” says Okun, executive director of Exalt Youth, an organization that works with teenagers after they leave the justice system.</p>
       
       <h3 align="center" class="subhed">So just how expensive will it be?</h3>

       <p>The cost question works in two ways: one that’s easy to calculate, about the concrete costs that would shift from the adult system to the juvenile and family court systems. But adovcates argue that these costs must be weighed against the other, more complicated questions about how much it costs society to maintain the status quo.</p>
       
       <p>In New York City, there are 860 sixteen and seventeen year olds currently incarcerated as adults, costing the state <a class="average" href="http://ibo.nyc.ny.us/cgi-park2/?p=516"> an average of $167,731</a> per inmate per year. Juvenile detention centers, on the other hand, cost about <a class="juve" href="http://www.youthrepresent.org/resources-overview/"> $210,000</a> per youth per year. That means that if the 860 teens were moved to juvenile detention, it would cost the city $42,269 dollars more per teen per year—a total of $36.4 million annually. To put that in perspective, it’s.05% of the city’s <a class="citybudget" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/21/nyregion/de-blasio-and-city-council-reach-deal-on-75-billion-budget.html"> 2014 - 2015 budget</a>. </p>
       
       <p>“The gross numbers are eye-catching,” says Okun. “They shock people.” </p>
       
       <p> Despite her strong support for changing the age, Judge Mendleson stresses that the family court system must receive extra funding to be able to do so responsibly. “We cannot take on yet another unfunded mandate,” she said.  </p>
       
       <p>Under their current caseload, family courts across the state are backlogged by about <a class="backlog" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/16/nyregion/dispute-over-judges-leaves-new-york-family-courts-in-limbo.html?_r=0"> 25% per year</a>, according to the New York Times. There are 149 judges in family courts statewide, and about one-third of them— 47 —are in New York City. In 2011, those judges received more than 715,000 filings. </p>
       
       <p>The impact that the backlog has on peoples’ lives is severe. When the courts are slow, families are separated longer: children remain in juvenile detention or with foster families. Perhaps most stunningly, after 18 consecutive months of foster care, parental rights can be permanently terminated — even if the process lasts that long only because family court is backlogged. </p>
       
       <p>To address this, in 2014 Gov. Cuomo allotted $5 million in extraordinary funds to family court, to add 20 judges statewide. </p>
       
       <p>If the 34,263 sixteen and seventeen year olds who appeared in criminal court in 2013 had instead been sent to family court – as they would be if the age were raised to 18 – that would mean one of two things: Either forty more judges are needed to absorb the new cases and distribute the existing 25% backlog, or more parents will risk permanently losing their children as family court slows. </p>
       
       <p>The current judgeships cost the state $33.8 million, or .02% of the annual <a class="statebudget" href="http://www.nysenate.gov/files/Adopted Budget 2014-15 Fact Sheet.pdf"> budget</a> ; with an additional forty, that number would be 41.8 million, or .03%. </p>
       
       <p>This is what the court would need to not only absorb the new cases but also erase the existing backlog. If the court were to absorb the new cases and maintain the current backlog, the state wouldn’t need to hire any new judges. </p>
       
       <p>Assemblyman Lentol argues that the cost “doesn’t legitimize doing nothing.” Instead, he says, it is “an excuse, but not a real reason not to change the policy.”</p>
       
       <p>He argues that when calculating cost, it’s important to look beyond just immediate expenses. It’s about how much it later costs society to address who he calls “hardened criminals”—people who, he believes, could have changed their lives had they been offered support as youths, instead of incarcerated with more experienced adult criminals.  </p>
       
       <p>Calculating the long-term cost of the policy is indeed more complex. It involves hypothetical questions: How much money would New York save if supportive intervention prevented sixteen and seventeen year olds from later committing crimes? Or: What is the cost—financially, morally—to a society when thousands of its young people struggle with prison-related trauma, or spent formative years of their lives behind bars?  </p>
       
       <p>This is what Okun calls the “collateral consequences of having a record.” When adults commit a crime, it follows them for their entire lives, forever. This makes it difficult to get a job, and impossible to vote, to be eligible for public housing and loans for school, and many other things. “All of your life options can be curtailed by being tried as an adult,” Okun summarizes. When children commit crimes, their records are sealed. Their mistakes don’t haunt them in that same way. They get second chances until they turn 18—or, in New York’s case, until they turn 16. </p>
       
       
       <h3 align="center" class="subhed">An Alternative: Diversion Programs</h3>
       
       <p>Because of the cost of incarceration and burgeoning population of prisons nationwide — up <a class="incarcerations" href="http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2013/9/30/report-finds-nycinmatecostalmostasmuchasivyleaguetuition.html"> 500% in the past 30 years</a>, giving the U.S. the world’s highest per-capita prison population — some say a better plan is to look beyond incarceration and detention in most cases. They argue that so-called “diversion programs” are a better alternative for the majority of youth. These programs could include everything from counseling and mentoring, to community service, to restorative justice youth courts. </p>
       
       <p>Okun, like many who work with youth who’ve been through the criminal justice system, believes that diversion programs offer what incarceration doesn’t. “Detention removes children from the resources and people they need. For the majority of kids it’s not only ineffective, it’s incredibly harmful,” she says. “The criminal justice system as it stands is punishing people for not having these essential things that are multi-generational: a quality education, dignified housing, supportive adults. The majority of kids need diversion programs. They need to be given what they didn’t have, not to be punished for what they didn’t have,” says Okun. </p>
       
       <p>This is a perspective shared by some teenagers who have participated in diversion programs. Darius is a 16-year-old member of a restorative justice youth court in Greenpoint, Brooklyn. A little over a year ago, Darius was “hanging with the wrong crowd,” he explained. He was picked up by the cops and sent to youth court. The experience worked: it shocked him enough that he was able to see beyond the peer pressure, and willing to change. When he finished his sentence of community service, he joined the court; now, two days every week he sits on a jury and tries to give other teens the same second chance. </p>
       
       <p>One recent case Darius heard involved a young man who was arrested with a friend for destruction of private property. One of the questions Darius asked the young man from the juror stand was whether he thought the other kid was a wise choice for a friend. The young man shook his head. Darius asked a follow-up: "Do you think you have a better idea of how to choose good friends now?" </p>
       
       <p>“Other courts should be like youth court,” Darius said after the hearing. “I know we’re young, but we’ve been through training and we know right from wrong. We listen to the person and we let them explain themselves,” he says. “Everybody’s got bumps in their lives, and everybody’s gotta fix those bumps. You just gotta talk to the right people.” </p>
       
       <p>Given that the majority of sixteen and seventeen year olds arrested in New York are for non-violence offenses, Okun says that all but “the most extreme cases” would benefit much more from diversion programs like youth court than from incarceration. Furthermore, she says, New York City already has many such programs to offer. “These are evidence-based, created to involve family, and they reduce recidivism and ensure public safety,” she says. </p>
      
       
       <p>Angelo Pinto, the juvenile justice campaign coordinator of the Correctional Association of New York, is hopeful the Governor Cuomo's commission will spur change. Although he admits that a “tremendous amount of reform” lies between the status quo and widespread use of diversion programs, he thinks that once it happens, it’ll save money and be more effective.  </p>
       
       <p>“A robust alternative to incarceration when they’re young disrupts a cycle,” he says. “This kids would later be in and out of adult facilities throughout their lives. That’s also a tremendous amount of money saved throughout the lifetime of each person,” he says. “When you look at it this way, it’s much more advantageous to raise the age, and shift the system to alternatives to incarceration that focus on investment in young people.”  </p>
