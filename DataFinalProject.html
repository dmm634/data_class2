<p> New York is one of only two states in the country that prosecutes 16 and 17 year old teenagers as adults. Wide civil society coalitions have pressured for more than a decade to have the policy changed. Governor Cuomo, in response to these demands, tasked a committee with studying the policy and releasing “actionable recommendations”—it will be released by the end of 2014. As we wait for concrete changes, it’s worth an examination of the policy’s impact now through the numbers—and the impact its change could have. </p>
