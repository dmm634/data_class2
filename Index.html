<h1>Data Pitches, Mackey:</h1>
<h2>Pitch one:</h2>
<p>New York and North Carolina are the only two states in the U.S. that hold the adult age of criminal responsibility at 16. This is an extremely controversial policy. I would like to visualize the effects of the policy in several ways, as a means not of making any definitive conclusions about whether it is effective, but instead, to display the ways it affects the lives of the kids involved, and to explore the differences in crime and recidivism rates between states that maintain the age of adult responsibility at 18 and these two who hold it at 16.</p>  
<p>First, I would like to visualize for readers how many 16 and 17 year olds we are talking about; how many teens have been treated as adults in New York and North Carolina since 2009. I would like to visualize how many more years they are serving in prison than 16 and 17 year-olds who have been found guilty of the same offenses in other states. Another way to do so is to look at the sentences for 15 year olds found guilty of the same offenses who are residents of NC or NY. I would then propose two ways of examining the effectiveness of 16 as the legal age of responsibility: one, the relationship between recidivism and this method of dealing with the kids; and two, whether this age group commits fewer crimes as a result of the legal age of responsibility. I would propose to explore recidivism by comparing recidivism rates by 14/15 year olds with 16/17 year olds in New York and North Carolina. I would also compare recidivism by 16/17 year olds in New York and North Carolina with national averages. To explore whether the age of responsibility deters crime, I would visualize general crime statistics (adjusted for population) by 16 year olds in New York and North Carolina, compared to the same statistics by 16 year olds elsewhere, to see if an argument could be made that the threat of prosecution as an adult keeps crime rates lower. None of this proves definite causal relationships, but it does help start a data-based discussion about New York and North Carolina’s rare policy.</p> 
<h2>Pitches two and three:</h2>
<p>In May 2014, twenty-year-old Brandon Ellingson drowned while in the custody of the Missouri Water Patrol. Ellingson, an Iowa resident, was arrested on suspicion of boating while intoxicated. The officer who arrested him, Trooper Piercy, placed Ellingson in his speedboat, handcuffed him, put a life jacket on him, and drove off. In the middle of the lake, Ellingson suddenly “jumped or fell” off the boat. His life jacket came off upon contact with the water; handcuffed, he drowned. Piercy had committed many mistakes—including that he didn’t use the right type of life jacket, he didn’t properly fasten it, he didn’t have an SD card in the camera installed in the boat which would give definitive answers about culpability, and he is alleged by one of few witnesses to have calmly watched Ellingson struggle in the water, not jumping in until it was too late to save him. In September, a coroner’s inquest in Missouri found the death to be accidental, and the Missouri state prosecutor has said she will not pursue criminal charges.</p>
<p>There are many accusations of wrongdoing flying about in this controversial case. Two of the most interesting involve immunity laws for law enforcement, and the policy of merging state trooper and water patrol forces as a means of saving money.</p> 
<p>Qualified immunity laws are laws that can protect law enforcement who kill or hurt suspects of crimes while in the custody of law enforcement. The idea behind these laws is to help law enforcement do their job---an unfortunate side effect of their dangerous job is that sometimes, people get hurt, the argument goes. However, criticism of the policy is that these laws encourage environments of impunity by turning what for a normal citizen would be a homicide charge into an excusable offense. Given the extreme militarization of local police that became apparent post-Ferguson, that law enforcement enjoys this type of immunity is concerning.</p>
<p>Qualified immunity laws apply in all states, but they are enforced with different frequencies. I propose to examine states that enforce those laws more heavily—meaning, adjusted for population/number of law enforcement officers, the states that most often grant law enforcement immunity. I am interested in whether those states also have more instances of citizens hurt or killed while in police custody. That does not establish a causal relationship, but it can suggest an interesting line of inquiry.</p> 
<p>However, finding the data to fulfill this idea may be difficult. The Bureau of Justice Statistics has a database of arrest-related deaths (by state, age and race of victim, and cause of death, i.e. suicide, homicide, accident) through the year 2009. But one problem is that newer government statistics don’t exist, and even those that do aren’t reliable, as everyone from Nate Silver to the Daily Show’s Samantha Bee have pointed out. So, we do not actually know how many citizens are killed in police custody in the U.S.</p>
<p>One tidbit that Trooper Piercy has used several times in his own defense is that he was never properly trained to be a water trooper. This leads us to the second pitch related to this story. Indeed, Piercy spent his entire career as a Highway Patrol officer, until in three years ago, when the state of Missouri attempted to cut costs by combining their Water and Highway patrols. Piercy argues that the fact that he wasn’t properly trained explains the many errors he made. Those errors were costly; they turned a twenty-year-old college kid’s afternoon boating party into the day he drowned while handcuffed by an authority tasked with protecting him. Thus, what caused his mistakes is of much interest.</p>
<p>I propose an examination of how many states throughout the country have combined their State and Water Patrol units. I would compare the numbers of people injured and killed in the custody of the combined patrol units, with the numbers of people injured and killed in the custody of patrol units that maintain their separate identities. (Again, however, in this story I will run up against the lack of comprehensive data about arrest-related deaths.)</p>
