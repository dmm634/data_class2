<h1>Data Pitches, Take Two, Mackey:</h1>
<h2>Pitch one:</h2>

<p>New York and North Carolina are the only two states in the U.S. that hold the adult age of criminal responsibility at 16. This is an extremely controversial policy. I’d like to visualize the effects of the policy in several ways, as a means of asking (and answering) the question: What is the impact of the age of responsibility at 16? The ways of answering that question are: How many 16-18 year olds are being treated as adults by the New York courts? How much does it cost New York to treat them as adults, compared to how much it’d cost them to treat them as juveniles?</p> 

<p>My data source is the number of “Youthful offenders” arrested in NY state, from NY DCJS adult arrest records by county. I’ll gather the numbers of “youthful offenders” arrested in each county, for each year 2009- 2013. (Not all counties in NY state contribute this information, so analysis only available for those that do.) That will help visualize the number of kids who are currently being treated as adults in the New York system.</p>

<p>I’ll visualize the issue nation-wide: Currently an estimated 200,000 youth are tried, sentenced, or incarcerated as adults every year across the United States, according to the National Juvenile Justice Network. I’ll visualize the percentage that New York contributes to that overall number.</p> 

<p>I’ll also analyze the issue according to cost. I’ll compare the cost of incarcerating adults vs. the cost of incarcerating juveniles in New York. I’ll calculate, based on the number of 16 - 18 year olds who are currently in adult prisons in New York, how different the cost to the state would be if those kids were in juvenile facilities, instead. I’ll also visualize the experiences that other states have had in raising their age of adult responsibility to 18—the way this choice has affected them financially.</p> 

<p>If any of this data analysis doesn’t yield sufficient results for a story, further data is here.</p> 

<p> P.S. I am still working on finding out how many states have combined their Water and Highway Patrols. I’m not sure if that’s possible, but it will be my #1 choice if so because it may involve the creation of a database that doesn’t yet exist. That would mean my final project would be this story:</p> 

<p>In May 2014, twenty-year-old Brandon Ellingson drowned while in the custody of the Missouri Water Patrol. Ellingson, an Iowa resident, was arrested on suspicion of boating while intoxicated. The officer who arrested him, Trooper Piercy, placed Ellingson in his speedboat, handcuffed him, put a life jacket on him, and drove off. In the middle of the lake, Ellingson suddenly “jumped or fell” off the boat. His life jacket came off upon contact with the water; handcuffed, he drowned. Piercy had committed many mistakes—including that he didn’t use the right type of life jacket, he didn’t properly fasten it, he didn’t have an SD card in the camera installed in the boat which would give definitive answers about culpability, and he is alleged by one of few witnesses to have calmly watched Ellingson struggle in the water, not jumping in until it was too late to save him. In September, a coroner’s inquest in Missouri found the death to be accidental, and the Missouri state prosecutor has said she will not pursue criminal charges.</p>

<p>There are many accusations of wrongdoing flying about in this controversial case. One of the most interesting involves the policy of merging state trooper and water patrol forces as a means of saving money.</p> 

Trooper Piercy has used several times in his own defense is that he was never properly trained to be a water trooper. This leads us to the second pitch related to this story. Indeed, Piercy spent his entire career as a Highway Patrol officer, until in three years ago, when the state of Missouri attempted to cut costs by combining their Water and Highway patrols. Piercy argues that the fact that he wasn’t properly trained explains the many errors he made. Those errors were costly; they turned a twenty-year-old college kid’s afternoon boating party into the day he drowned while handcuffed by an authority tasked with protecting him. Thus, what caused his mistakes is of much interest.</p>

<p>I propose an examination of how many states throughout the country have combined their State and Water Patrol units. I would compare the numbers of people injured and killed in the custody of the combined patrol units, with the numbers of people injured and killed in the custody of patrol units that maintain their separate identities. (Again, however, in this story I will run up against the lack of comprehensive data about arrest-related deaths.)</p>
